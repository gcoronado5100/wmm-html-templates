                    <p>We asked Jim, a successful business owner in Chicago, what he would do differently if he could go back to when he was first struggling to grow his business. We also asked how he would build the business if he started with $100 million in the bank.His answer might surprise you:</p>

            </div>
            <div class="col">
                <p>“I would pay someone to mentor me.</p> 
                <p>Getting mentored or coached by someone that has done it before you and has insider knowledge is the fastest path to success. For example, if you wanted to learn how to play Tennis professionally, what would be the fastest path to get there? Obviously hiring a mentor or coach would be the fastest and maybe the only way to get there. And the more access you had with the coach, the faster your results would be.</p>
                <p>It seems so obvious to me now. Not only can a mentor or coach provide you with tools and techniques to shortcut your success, but they can hold you accountable, help you organize your thoughts, and provide feedback and support as you grow.The bottom line is that the more access you have to a mentor or coach, the faster you will reach your goals.”</p>
                <p>Great answer Jim. We agree. A coach will significantly accelerate your success which is why its the secret ingredient for so many successful people. But you don’t need $100 million in the bank to get access to a coach and mentor for scaling your business. We are right here, and we have created this comprehensive guide to help shortcut your path for scaling your business and experiencing true time freedom.

            <div class="col">
                <p><strong>First off, what is the ultimate goal for a business owner?</strong></p>
                <p>It is to build a company that he or she can one day sell, continue to scale, or own passively.</p>

                <p><strong>And, what gets in the way of this?</strong></p>
                <p>Most business owners reach for growth by working harder and personally trying to produce more. This is a flawed model that at best will lead to only moderate growth. At worst, this strategy can literally put your entire company at risk.</p>

                <p><strong>So, what can we do to reach the ultimate goal?</strong></p>
                <p>Use the Level Three Roadmap, a comprehensive model for building and scaling your business.</p>

                <p><strong>Ok, but what is the Level Three Roadmap?</strong></p>

                        <p>Your business is in its infancy, scrambling to make those early sales and fulfill customer promises.</p>
                        <p>This is the time to learn your business and market, and if needed, discover and fix any fatal flaws in your business model or how your targeted customers perceive the value you’re creating. Your early focus while launching a business isn’t on building the perfect product or service, but rather on figuring out how you can get people to buy. Too many entrepreneurs get caught in the trap of making the perfect widget, but never actually sell enough of that widget to ensure a profit. Of course you need to deliver on your promises, but you can iterate and improve your product or service as you go. Without sales, you have no business. At this stage, you’ll be wearing just about every hat in the business. That’s OK for now, but as you move toward Middle Stage Level Two, you’ll need to find ways to leverage your personal production for the business by hiring staff and building the basic business systems and controls you need. An Early Stage Level Two business is working to generate sales, establish a market position, and become a sustainable business.</p>

                        <p>Once your business is profitable and you are confident that it is going to survive, it is time to build your business’s four core systems: 1. Lead Generation: your system for finding prospects. 2. Lead Conversion: your system for closing sales. 3. Production and Delivery: your system for producing and fulfilling your core product or service. 4. Collections: your system for collecting on what you are owed. These four systems—for finding leads, closing sales, producing your product or service, and collecting on your receivables— are the four core systems of every business.</p>

                        <p>Advanced Stage Level Two: Your business is growing fast, with employee leaders in two or more of your five core pillars (Sales/ Marketing, Operations, Finance, Team, and Executive Leadership). You’re in the process of refining your business systems and building your management team. </p>

                        <p>At Advanced Stage Level Two, you’ll begin the important work of refining your systems, building your management team, and scaling your business in earnest. This is the “Rapid Growth” stage of your business. In this stage you’ll also begin to build out the auxiliary systems you need in other parts of your company, from hiring to training to marketing to managing and more. You’ll see that your revenue is exploding and often you’ll feel like your business is bursting at the seams as you struggle to keep up with the growth. A key shift at this stage is to enroll your team in building the systems, controls, and scalable solutions your business needs alongside you. Where a Middle Stage Level Two business owner commonly sees her team as a way to leverage her own personal production, an Advanced Stage Level Two business owner sees her team as partners in taking the business to the next level. This essential shift is what allows businesses to successfully make the leap to Level Three.</p>

                        <p><strong>Choosing and executing on your “exit strategy”—to sell, scale, or own passively.</strong> </p>

                        <p>Level Three: Your business is firing on all cylinders with employee leaders in at least four of your five core pillars. Your business is systems-reliant and ready for you to choose your exit strategy—to sell, scale, or own passively.</p>

                        <p>A Level Three business is systems reliant, with a winning management team in place, and strong internal controls that allow the business to run smoothly and effectively independent of any one person. At this point, you truly have built a business, not a self-employed job. The business runs smoothly and your clients look to the business, not the owner, to fulfill on its promises. Now it is time to determine and execute your exit strategy. This may or may not mean actually selling your business. In fact, many Level Three business owners choose to stay actively engaged. What’s the critical distinction? Continued involvement is a personal choice, not a business requirement. You get to make that decision and choose any of these three main exit strategies: 1. You can sell the business and move on to your next great adventure. 2. You can scale the business to the big time. 3. You can passively own the business, with a greatly diminished role for yourself in its daily operation, generally fewer than five hours a week.</p>
