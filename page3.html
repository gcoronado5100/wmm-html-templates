                    <p>Understanding your business context—the map of the market in which you sell, produce, fulfill, and grow your business—is crucial in building a scalable business. </p>
                    <p>Today we’ll guide you through a simple process to clearly lay out the three dimensions of your business context—your customers, your competition, and your positioning.</p>
                    <p>When we’re done, you’ll have a clear, concrete picture of your target market, including the critical “Marketing Markers” that will help you qualify and screen for your best buyers. </p>

                <p>You’ll also get a simple chart, the Competitive Matrix, to determine how you stack up against your competition in eight key criteria, so that you can narrow your focus to the one or two elements that you need to leverage to effectively compete. </p>

                <p>And finally, we’ll give you two powerful tools to help you intentionally craft your market position and brand that work in the stressed-out and resource-strapped world of small business. </p>

                <p>Let’s get started with the first dimension of your business context—your customers</p>
            </div>

            <div class="title-row">
                <h2>Your Customers—Whom You Serve <br> and What They Really Want</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="col">
                <p>As crazy as it seems, most business owners never concretely clarify whom they serve and what this target market really wants.</p> 
                <p>The average owner is so busy marketing, selling, producing, and fulfilling that they never step back and think through precisely whom they serve, much less the deep aspirations, fears, hopes, dreams, and frustrations of this target market.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row-2x">
                <div class="col">
                    <p>This makes about as much sense as the salesperson who spends all day going door to-door selling pool care products—in an apartment complex! When you ask him why he’d waste his time selling a product that clearly this group of people is unlikely to buy, he says, “The doors are so close together that I can call on five times as many people than if I go to the neighborhood you suggest.” </p>
                    <p>Can you tell us who the ideal target market for your product or service is? </p>
                    <p>Within that target market, who are your best prospects? </p>
                    <p>Too many businesses take a broad approach to marketing and claim that “everyone” in their target market can use their product or service. </p>
                    <p>This is ineffective. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col image-container">
                    <img src="./assets/img/page3/img2.png" >
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="container pop-content after-pop">
                <p>Instead, think of your marketing the way the world’s most successful companies do: as a series of concentric circles. In the middle of the target, the center of the bull’s-eye, are the people who are most likely to use your product now and have the highest closing ratio. If you approach these people, you’ll have the shortest sales cycle. Identifying those “fastest to close” customers in your target market is critical to achieving momentum in growing your sales. </p>

                <p>Here is a list of prompts to help you clarify who your target market and ideal customer are by determining what key elements your best customers have in common. While not every question will apply to your business, most will. We encourage you to pause with each item and jot quick notes as you go. The list of prompts will differ if you sell business to business or business to consumer, so choose the applicable list. Follow the cascading series of questions to determine the key elements that ultimately identify who your best buyers likely are, and the target market you’re going to go after (and which tempting markets are distractions you’ll avoid for now).</p>
